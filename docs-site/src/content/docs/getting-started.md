description: Install, run, and develop the VVF Astro site locally.

## Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build) 7, server output, `@astrojs/node` adapter
- [EmDash](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/cms/emdash/) — self-hosted, database-backed CMS integration (SQLite locally)
- React (for EmDash's admin UI) + Tailwind CSS

## Install and run

### Option 1: Dev container (recommended)

Open the repo in a dev container-capable editor (VS Code, GitHub Codespaces) and reopen in container. It's pinned to Node 22, preinstalls Playwright's system dependencies, and runs `npm ci` for both the root project and `docs-site/` on create — no manual install steps. Ports `4321` (site + EmDash admin) and `6006` (Storybook) are forwarded to the host automatically; `docs-site`'s own dev server also uses `4321`.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The container is named `vvf-dev-container` ("VVF dev container" in the editor) and keeps a few things apart from your host:

- **Its own `node_modules`:** the named volumes `vvf-dev-node-modules` and `vvf-dev-docs-node-modules`, so installing Linux builds of native packages never touches a host checkout's `node_modules`. You can run `npm run dev` on the host and in the container (one at a time: both use port 4321 and the same `data.db`).
- **Docker inside:** `docker` and `docker compose` work from the container, using the host's Docker engine (`docker compose up --build` for the [Postgres + S3 stack](/running-anywhere/)). Containers started from inside run on the host, so their ports are on the host's `localhost` (from inside the container, use `host.docker.internal:<port>`).
- **Memory:** building the site needs a few GB. If a build inside the container is `Killed`, give Docker Desktop more memory (Settings → Resources) or stop other containers.

After changing `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, use "Rebuild Container"; the `node_modules` volumes are kept between rebuilds.

### Option 2: Manual setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts the site at `http://localhost:4321` and the EmDash admin at `http://localhost:4321/_emdash/admin`.

On first run, EmDash creates a local `data.db` and seeds it from [`seed/seed.json`](https://github.com/anclist/vvf-astro/blob/main/seed/seed.json) — the site's content schema (collections + fields) and starter content, both version-controlled. `data.db`, `.emdash/`, and `/uploads` are local/generated and gitignored; nothing about them needs to be committed.

## Basecamp CLI

Requirements for this project are tracked as cards on the VVF project's "Tareas" board in Basecamp, worked through as openspec changes. To connect:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://basecamp.com/install-cli | bash   # already run automatically in the dev container
basecamp auth login                                  # one-time, opens a browser to approve
```

Once authenticated, `basecamp cards list -p 43742602` lists VVF's cards. When an openspec change implements a specific card, its `proposal.md` links to that card's Basecamp URL; archiving the change closes the loop with `basecamp cards done <id|url>`.

In the dev container (no OS keyring available), the CLI stores credentials in plaintext at `~/.config/basecamp/credentials.json` — outside the repo, but treat that file as a secret on shared/ephemeral containers.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Dev server at `localhost:4321` |
| `npm run build` | Production build to `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |
| `npm run seed` | Re-apply `seed/seed.json` to the local database |
| `npm run verify-menu` | Check nav menu URLs in `seed/seed.json` against real routes |
| `npm run storybook` | Storybook dev server at `localhost:6006` |
| `npm run build-storybook` | Static Storybook build |
| `npm run test` | Full suite: unit → Storybook → e2e, in order |
| `npm run test:unit` | Vitest, `src/**/*.test.ts` |
| `npm run test:watch` | Vitest in watch mode |
| `npm run test:storybook` | Boots Storybook, runs `@storybook/test-runner` against it |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright, `e2e/**` |

See [Testing & CI](/testing-and-ci/) for details on the test suites.

## Environment

No environment variables are required for local dev — see `.env.example`. Production deploy target (hosting, database, media storage) has not been decided yet; local dev uses SQLite and local disk.
